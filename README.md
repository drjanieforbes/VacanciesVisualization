# VacanciesVisualization
This project seeks to develop a data visualization of vacant residence data from Housing and Urban Development (HUD) data.

An initial attempt to use R to both process and visualize the data has failed (see R script).

The plan is to use Python to summarize the data, and R to visualize it.

Summarization of the data involves calculating sums at multiple spatial scales:  national, state, county.  The data is already available at individual Census Tract level.
